# JAVA_Project
The code in the "restaurant-billing-system-master" repository is a Java project designed to manage billing transactions and menu items in a restaurant. The project includes various Java classes such as Bill.java, Customer.java, Employee.java, Item.java, Menu.java, and Order.java that have different functionalities.

The project uses a text file named "database.txt" that stores the details of menu items and employees in a tabular format. The Main.java class is the main entry point for the program and initiates the creation of the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI is created using Swing and allows users to enter the details of the customer, employee, and ordered items. The GUI also displays the final bill details to the user.

The Customer.java class stores the personal details of the customer like name, contact number, and address. The Employee.java class stores the details of restaurant staff like their name, job code, salary, and contact details. The Item.java class stores the details of menu items like item name, price, and category. The Menu.java class displays the menu items to the customers. The Order.java class creates food orders for customers which include order ID, list of menu items ordered, and total cost. 

The Bill.java class generates the final bill details based on the food orders made by customers by calculating the total costs and taxes. Thus, the project serves as a simple billing and inventory management system for a restaurant.

Overall, the code uses object-oriented programming concepts to develop a simple billing and menu management system for the restaurant industry. It allows restaurant staff to easily manage their menu items and generate bills for their customers.
